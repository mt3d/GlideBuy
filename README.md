GlideBuy is an experimental ecommerce project developed for educational and learning purposes. The primary goal of the project is to explore and better understand the architecture, design patterns, and practical challenges involved in building modern ecommerce platforms using ASP.NET Core and related technologies.

The project serves as a sandbox for experimenting with concepts such as backend APIs, frontend integration, data modeling, extensibility, performance considerations, and common ecommerce features. It is intentionally designed as a learning environment rather than a production-ready system, and many components may be incomplete or simplified.

GlideBuy is not intended for commercial use, production deployment, or real-world business operations. It should not be used, modified, or distributed for any commercial purposes.

By using or exploring this project, you acknowledge that it exists solely as an educational exercise aimed at improving practical knowledge of ASP.NET Core and ecommerce system design.
